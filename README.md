- Deploy the smart contract on your preferred blockchain.
- Copy the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and contract address.
- Paste these details into constants.js.

Once you have completed the steps above, run the following command to start the server:

Run ```npm start```. 
This command runs the application in development mode. 

Open ```http://localhost:3000``` in your browser to view it.
